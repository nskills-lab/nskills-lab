### Hi there 👋!  My name is Nina.  I am a QA Automation Engineer with experience in software testing. Throughout my career I worked with automation frameworks based on:
• programming languages like JavaScript, Ruby, and Python
• tools such as Selenium WebDriver, Cucumber, Cypress, and Appium
both within the startup and enterprise-focused environments.
